# Principles

RNA is your low-abstraction, anti-framework boilerplate for production grade projects.

From frontend to backend, leverage the most robust set of technologies for your next web application.

RNA is a "batteries included" foundation, including deep backend and devops integration with Amazon Web Services.

### Modern

Latest and greatest web technologies are utilized, while not leaning into the bleeding edge of unstable tech.

- Single Page Application with code splitting at page level.
- Typescript, ESlint, Prettier for code formatting.
- Shared types across backend and frontend.
- Dead simple typescript integration, avoiding the bad and complex parts of Typescript.
- Frontend and Backend hot reloading.
- Docker & ECS.
- DynamoDB single table design (SQL support planned in future release)
- World class DX and application performance.
- AI IDE integration via custom Cursor rules.

### Minimal

Embrace web standards, simple solutions, and procedural programming.

Every effort is made to reduce external dependencies to a bare minimum, while offering enough of a foundation to cover the rough edges.

- Native browser APIs: fetch, history, events.
- Native node APIs: fetch, crypto.
- No react-router, redux, zustand, or other "state management" libs.
- No react-hook-form, formik, or form libs.
- No React.Suspense, React.Lazy, or other useless abstractions.
- No express-session, cookie-session, or external auth libs.
- Use basic react APIs: useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext.
- Use webpack dynamic import for code splitting.
- Auth is implemented from scratch, sessions are saved and stored in the database.

### Mainstream

Only the most robust, stable, and upward trending libraries are included.

NPM Trends is consulted for user traction and longevity before a new library is integrated.
