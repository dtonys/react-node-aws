# Principles

RNA is your low-abstraction, anti-framework boilerplate for production grade projects.

From frontend to backend, leverage the most robust set of technologies for your next web application.

RNA is a "batteries included" foundation, including deep backend and devops integration with Amazon Web Services.

### Modern

Latest and greatest web technologies are utilized, while not leaning into the bleeding edge of unstable tech.

### Minimal

Embrace web standards, simple solutions, and procedural programming.

Every effort is made to reduce external dependencies to a bare minimum, while offering enough of a foundation to cover the rough edges.

### Mainstream

Only the most robust, stable, and upward trending libraries are included.

NPM Trends is consulted for user traction and longevity before a new library is integrated.
